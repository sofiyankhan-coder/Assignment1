                <p> Hey! My name is Sofiyan and I am currently a second year university student pursuing an undergrad degree for Networking and IT security at 
                    Ontario Tech University. I was inspired by my big brother to get into this field, and I hope I can learn a lot in these 4 years and solidify my knowledge
                    relating to Networking and Cyber Security. When it comes to general hobbies. I enjoy watching soccer, playing video games, and watching ufc. 
                    My favourite ufc fighter is Islam makachev because of his fighting style and his personality.</p>
