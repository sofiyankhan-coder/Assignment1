color scheme: My color scheme of choice is Dark brown for the background(hex:#382F2F), and creamish color for the text(hex:). I like the earthy vibe it gives so that is why I chose it.

Linear and angle gradients: I added these to the banner for the nav tag links for each html section. The gradient color scheme I used is the same one from the tutorials, I figured it would suit the brown background so that is why I chose it.
